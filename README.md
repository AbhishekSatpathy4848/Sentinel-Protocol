# üõ°Ô∏è Sentinel Protocol

**AI-Powered Web3 Reputation Protocol for Autonomous Portfolio Protection**

Built with **Hedera**, **Pyth Network**, and **Lit Protocol (Vincent)**  
> _Empowering long-term crypto investors through decentralized, AI-driven decision-making._

---

## üìò Overview

**Sentinel Protocol** is an **AI-powered Web3 reputation protocol** that protects long-term crypto investors by analyzing **news, market feeds, and on-chain reputation**, enabling **user-authorized portfolio actions**.  

The system continuously monitors token credibility, detects market anomalies, and autonomously executes user-approved actions (like swaps, stakes, or rebalances) ‚Äî ensuring safety during sudden market changes.

## üöÄ Core Idea

Sentinel Protocol introduces a **reputation-driven safeguard layer** for crypto portfolios.  
By combining **AI agents**, **on-chain data**, and **user-controlled execution**, it ensures **non-custodial, transparent, and intelligent portfolio management**.

At its core lies a network of **autonomous agents**:
- **Price Feed Agent** ‚Äî Fetches real-time prices from **Coingecko** and on-chain **Pyth** feeds  
- **News Feed Agent** ‚Äî Gathers market sentiment and coin-related headlines  
- **Reputation Agent** ‚Äî Evaluates token credibility from Hedera-based reputation data  
- **Decision Agent** ‚Äî Aggregates all inputs and proposes optimal actions  
- **Authorization Agent** ‚Äî Validates and approves actions before execution  
- **Execution Agent (Vincent)** ‚Äî Executes approved trades or staking actions via **Lit Protocol**

This system creates a **trust-minimized, intelligent, and self-evolving orchestration** between AI, blockchain data, and decentralized execution.

## üí° Architecture

<!-- Add the overall diagram here & the explanation for the flow -->


<!-- Add the AI orchestration diagram here -->
![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

The orchestration follows this flow:
1. A trigger (periodic or market-based) hits the Next.js backend endpoint `/api/agent/orchestrate`.
2. The orchestrator invokes the **Price**, **News**, and **Reputation Agents** to collect real-time context.
3. The **Decision Agent** processes all insights to generate a proposed action.
4. The **Authorization Agent** validates the proposal based on user-defined constraints.
5. If approved, the **Executor Agent** (via **Vincent**) executes the swap or staking action.
6. If rejected, the decision is revised up to two iterations.

Each agent communicates using **Hedera Agent Kit‚Äôs A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** framework (based on the Google A2A standard), enabling decentralized orchestration and auditability.

## üß† AI + Web3 Integration

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hedera** | Enables decentralized agent communication and on-chain reputation computation |
| **Pyth Network** | Provides real-time, verifiable price feeds and entropy-based randomness for stochastic modeling |
| **Lit Protocol / Vincent** | Manages user authorization and secure, delegated action execution |
| **Next.js Backend** | Hosts the orchestrator API for triggering and streaming real-time agent updates |
| **OpenAI / LangChain** | Used to summarize agent responses and enhance decision interpretability |

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Price Integration**
- Fetches **live crypto prices** from **Pyth Network**
- Performs **price staleness checks** and **confidence interval analysis**
- Supports multi-token portfolios (BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC, AAVE, DOGE, USDC)

### 2. **Reputation Scoring Engine**
- Evaluates **Market Stability**, **Fundamental Strength**, and **Risk Exposure**
- Aggregates into a **composite on-chain reputation score**
- Publishes reputation updates periodically to the Hedera sidechain

### 3. **Entropy-Powered Randomness**
- Leverages **Pyth Entropy** for verifiable randomness
- Introduces **stochastic variance** in reputation computation
- Reduces manipulation by making score generation unpredictable yet deterministic

### 4. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication**
- Fully modular and decentralized AI agents
- Agents collaborate, revise, and validate decisions through Hedera A2A
- Enables **multi-agent negotiation and consensus**

### 5. **Secure Delegated Execution**
- Uses **Lit Protocol (Vincent)** for cryptographically secure authorization
- Executes trades or staking actions **only after explicit user policy validation**
- Maintains a **non-custodial model** ‚Äî users retain asset control
